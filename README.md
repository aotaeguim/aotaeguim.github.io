### Welcome to my website

I am a Data Analyst and Project Manager at the [Latin-American Laboratory for Assessment of the Quality of Education](https://www.unesco.org/es/fieldoffice/santiago/expertise/llece) (LLECE) at [UNESCO Santiago](https://www.unesco.org/es/fieldoffice/santiago). My research interests focus on inequalities related to socioeconomic status and social class, as well as the role of knowledge and sciences in social life.

Previously, I served as Research Manager at [JPAL-LAC](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/es/latinoam%C3%A9rica-caribe) and have collaborated as a research assistant on various research projects. I hold a [Master in Public Policy](https://www.postgradofen.uchile.cl/magíster-en-políticas-públicas-escuela-de-postgrado-facultad-de-economía-y-negocios-universidad-de-chile) from the University of Chile and both a Master's and Bachelor's degree in [Sociology](https://csociales.uahurtado.cl/departamentos/departamento-de-sociologia/) from Alberto Hurtado University.
