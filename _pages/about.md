<!--- I am a DPhil student in Sociology at [Nuffield College](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/people/profiles/till-hovestadt/) and the [Department of Sociology](https://www.sociology.ox.ac.uk/home) at the University of Oxford. I received a M.A. and a B.A. in Sociology from Alberto Hurtado University with a MPP from the University of Chile.

<!--- My research centers around inequalities with respect to socioeconomic status and social class. In my DPhil research, I investigate the segregation of social classes and how it affects interclass trust, cooperation and perceptions of inequalities. I am also interested in social norms, social cohesion, and deviance. You can download my full CV [here](https://github.com/TillHovestadt/CV/raw/main/CV_Hovestadt_EN.pdf).--->
