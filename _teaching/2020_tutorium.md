For two consecutive years, 2020 and 2021, I taught the tutorial accompagnying the graduate course *Multivariate Regression Analyses*, taught by Prof. Dr. Roger Berger. The tutorial primarily focussed on teaching the students advanced quantitative methods in R, but I also taught the basic theory of these methods.
